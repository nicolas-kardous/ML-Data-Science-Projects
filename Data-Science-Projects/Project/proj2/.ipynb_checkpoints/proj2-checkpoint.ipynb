    "In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "1. To find better features for my model, I used the code shown in the cell below to find the 60 most frequent words in emails that were classified as spam. Of course, the most frequent words were generic words like \"the, to, and, of\", so I chose to pick words that aren't as generic. Additionally, I looked at the most frequent words for emails that were classfied as ham, to make sure that the words I picked were not overlapping between the two. The specific words I found are shown in the cell below.\n",
    "2. At first, what didn't work was I was looking for the 60 most frequent words that appeared in spam emails that didn't show up for the 60 most frequent words in the ham emails. For example one of those words were \"free\". However, \"free\" is still a very frequent word in the ham emails, I did not notice it because there are a lot more ham emails than there are spam emails. Thus, to handle this, I used the code \"ham_email[ham_email.str.contains(\"free\")]\", and compared it to \"spam_email[spam_email.str.contains(\"free\")]\" to see the frequency of words found in both ham and spam emails. This worked for me because, from repeating this step multiple of times for different words, I was able to see which words were frequent in spam emails that were not frequent in ham emails.\n",
    "3. What was surprising for me was that a lot of the good features were words that had to do with fonts. For example, \"helvetica, arial, sans-serif\" were found predominantly in spam emails. What was also surprising was that I was expecting words like \"free\",\"coupon\",\"discount\" to be predominant in spam emails, but these words were found in both spam and ham emails."

    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
