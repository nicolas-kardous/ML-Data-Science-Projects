    "The code below defines a testing function that we'll use to verify that your data has the same statistics as what we expect. Run these cells to define the function. The `df_allclose` function has this name because we are verifying that all of the statistics for your dataframe are close to the expected values. Why not `df_allequal`? It's a bad idea in almost all cases to compare two floating point values like 37.780435, as rounding error can cause spurious failures."

    "Let's look at the distribution of inspection scores. As we saw before when we called `head` on this data frame, inspection scores appear to be integer values. The discreteness of this variable means that we can use a barplot to visualize the distribution of the inspection score. Make a bar plot of the counts of the number of inspections receiving each score. \n",

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
