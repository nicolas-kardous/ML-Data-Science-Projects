    "## Election Polling\n",
    "\n",
    "Political polling is a type of public opinion polling that can at best represent a snapshot of public opinion at the particular moment in time. Voter opinion shifts from week to week, even day to day, as candidates battle it out on the campaign field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polls usually start with a \"horse-race\" question, where respondents are asked whom they would vote for in a head-to-head race if the election were tomorrow: Candidate A or Candidate B. The survey begins with this question so that the respondent is not influenced by any of the other questions asked in the survey. Some of these other questions are asked to help assess how likely is it that the respondent will vote. Other questions are asked about age, education, and sex in order to adjust the findings if one group appears overly represented in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pollsters typically use [random digit dialing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_digit_dialing) to contact people."
